# Site2Local

Simple Python 3.X is an tool whole made by ChatGPT, which mirrors existing websites (both HTML-based and non-HTML like PHP backends) to run locally on `127.0.0.1`.

# What can I customize?

~~You can change if you want and dont want to bypass access denied~~  
~~You can enable hidden elements~~  
You can enable intelligent crawling, mirror detection, and device-based headers (mobile, tablet, desktop, Linux, bot, or auto). Customize freely based on your needs.

# What should I **not** do with this?

This tool **must not** be used for malicious, phishing, or deceptive purposes.

Site2Local was never intended to clone websites for misuse. Always run it on localhost or, if hosting something derived from it, make sure itâ€™s not a misleading copy of the original site.

Do **not** exploit this tool to break laws or harm others. You are responsible for any misuse.

# Can I edit the downloaded site files?

Yes, absolutely. You're free to modify the downloaded files as needed. Just remember: **do not use those changes for malicious intent**.
